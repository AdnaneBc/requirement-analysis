## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system needs to do by gathering and analyzing information from stakeholders. It helps define what features and functions the software should have, as well as how it should perform. This step is crucial in the software development lifecycle because it ensures that everyone—from clients to developers—is on the same page before any code is written. By clearly identifying requirements early on, teams can avoid misunderstandings, reduce costly changes later, and build a product that truly meets user needs.
